Nagios Network Analyzer - Minor improvements

In order to support flows and provide resources, the following kernel changes are required.
Some are set by the installation, I increased one since then.

In particular the kernel.sem

cat sysctl.conf
# Kernel sysctl configuration file for Red Hat Linux
#
# For binary values, 0 is disabled, 1 is enabled.  See sysctl(8) and
# sysctl.conf(5) for more details.

# Controls IP packet forwarding
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0

# Controls source route verification
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 1

# Do not accept source routing
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0

# Controls the System Request debugging functionality of the kernel
kernel.sysrq = 1

# Controls whether core dumps will append the PID to the core filename.
# Useful for debugging multi-threaded applications.
kernel.core_uses_pid = 1
kernel.shmmax = 536870912
kernel.shmall = 2097152
#kernel.sem = 250 32000 100 128
# SLB 2017-06-19 - changes per forum post
kernel.sem = 4096 1048576 4096 256
net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 9000 65500
net.core.rmem_default = 262144
net.core.wmem_default = 262144
net.core.rmem_max = 4194304
net.core.wmem_max = 262144


After the change run 'sysctl -p' as root to activate
