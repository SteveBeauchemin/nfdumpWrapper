Nagios Network Analyzer - Minor improvements

These are the basic steps in an order that made sense to me at the time.

This will uninstall enough of Nagios Network Analyzer that you will be able to do a clean install and start over. If you had done a backup, you can do a restore but the restore script is not very good. It uses mysql and not mariadb. It also tries to do something with iptables even though we have firewalld instead. It seems to be Red Hat 6 specific.

Your mileage may vary...

mysql -uroot -p[password]
drop database nagiosna;
exit

systemctl disable httpd
systemctl stop httpd
systemctl disable nagiosna
systemctl stop nagiosna
systemctl disable mariadb
systemctl stop mariadb

rm -rf /usr/local/nagiosna
rm -rf /var/www/html/nagiosna
rm -f /var/www/html/nna.php

yum -y remove wkhtmltox

rm -rf /tmp/nagiosna

cd /tmp
tar -xzvf nagiosna-2.2.3.tar.gz


cd /tmp/nagiosna

either edit fullinstall and change

       print_header "Nagios Network Analyzer"
        run_steps prereqs sourceguardian timezone rrdtool build_nfdump library_path nagiosna backend db firewall selinux install_mibs install_sudo install_cron wkhtmltopdf webroot daemons

remove build_nfdump
remove firewall
remove install_sudo

At this point, the full install should work.


The build nfdump will install an older version on top of the latest version. It will not work with the Wrapper.
